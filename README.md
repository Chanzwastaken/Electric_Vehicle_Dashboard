# Electric_Vehicle_Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market in the United States. It covers various aspects of the EV industry, including total vehicles, average electric range, market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and the distribution of EVs by state, make, and model.

The dashboard allows users to filter the data by city, electric utility, and EV type, giving them the ability to explore the EV landscape in greater detail. The "Total Vehicles by Model Year" graph showcases the growth of the EV market over time, highlighting the increasing adoption of these vehicles. The "Total Vehicles by State" map provides a visual representation of the geographic distribution of EVs across the United States.

Additionally, the dashboard offers insights into the CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility of various EV models, as well as the market share of different manufacturers. This information can be valuable for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumers interested in understanding the current state and trends of the EV market in the country.

Overall, this project dashboard serves as a comprehensive resource for analyzing and tracking the progress of the electric vehicle industry in the United States, aiding in informed decision-making and strategic planning for the future of sustainable transportation.
